#' Power calculation within stepped wedge design model by Hussey et.al 
#'
#' @description Calculation of power for a lmm with cluster as random effect, fixed timepoint effects, but set to null, TP number of timepoints, I number of cluster. The design matrix has to be coded by zeros and ones.
#' @param ThetaEst expected treatment effect
#' @param alpha singificance level (by default 0.05)
#' @param Design design matrix for a given SWD model
#' @param sigmaq within cluster variance
#' @param tauq between cluster variance
#' @param time a logical (FALSE, if no time trends are expected, otherwise TRUE)
#' @return Aproximated power of two tailed test, although the design matrix is fractionated, then power is not valid
